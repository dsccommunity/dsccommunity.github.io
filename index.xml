The main purpose is to handle better the increased community contributions, and remove hindrance to improvements by spreading the load on a Committee, and giving more privileges to the maintainers.</description>

      <description>Line length not longer than 80 characters Rows longer than 80 characters should be split into multiple lines where appropriate. This helps make it easier for reviewers to make review comments and for the contributors to see where the requested changes are (without scrolling). It is also easier to see the lines in split view mode when the lines don&amp;rsquo;t wrap on the screen. It will also improve the readability when using git diff.</description>
