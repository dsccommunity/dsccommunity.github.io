      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s good to make sure we understand the world in which DSC evolves, so I thought of writing this post below. Unfortunately, the future is not something we can predict, so this is just a personal opinion, which I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll find useful.
Configuration Management evolution Some like to classify different configuration management models, but I prefer to show them as an evolution of similar principles, that happened with the evolution of technology and principles.</description>

      <description>The DSC Resource Kit A lot has changed since the creation of the DSC Resource Kit back in 2013â€”the PowerShell/DSC Team initiative was created to seed the DSC Ecosystem.
The intention then was to illustrate the capabilities of DSC, and solve realistic configuration scenarios to build a community of users. The team had been developing the resources and publishing them as the PowerShell Team in TechNet Gallery, long before the PowerShell Gallery existed.</description>

      <title>What is Desired State Configuration</title>
      <link>https://dsccommunity.org/help/what-is-dsc/</link>

      <description>As per the official documentation, Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform in PowerShell.
It is built around different components:
 DSC DSL: The Domain Specific Language of DSC with the Configuration keyword. DSC LCM: The Local Configuration Manager (LCM), that can be seen as the agent enacting the configurations on the managed nodes. DSC Resources: A rich ecosystem of modules exposing a declarative and idempotent interface to imperative code configuring resources.</description>

      <description>Goal and purpose Previously owned by the DSC Team, and more specifically by Katie, the DSC Resources are now owned by the DSC Community: a collective of Open Source maintainers getting together to improve the Resources, their quality and the practices around DSC.
The main purpose is to handle better the increased community contributions, and remove hindrance to improvements by spreading the load on a Committee, and giving more privileges to the maintainers.</description>

      <description>Creating the md file is easy, but you might want to double check how it will render on the website. To do so, we recommend you to install Hugo (using Chocolatey it&amp;rsquo;s just a choco install hugo) and test what you create.
But when you have installed hugo, forked the dsccommunity.org, and cloned your fork locally, you can generate a post from the template, from the source directory:
 C:\src\dsccommunity.org &amp;gt; hugo new blog/your-title-in-lowercase.</description>

      <description>Line length not longer than 80 characters Rows longer than 80 characters should be split into multiple lines where appropriate. This helps make it easier for reviewers to make review comments and for the contributors to see where the requested changes are (without scrolling). It is also easier to see the lines in split view mode when the lines don&amp;rsquo;t wrap on the screen. It will also improve the readability when using git diff.</description>

      <description>Despite the few &amp;ldquo;DSC Planning Updates&amp;rdquo; written by Michael Greene (Program Manager for DSC, and DSC Community Committee member), there are still misunderstandings by the community with regards to the directions Microsoft is taking for DSC and its ecosystem.
Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain what we understand from the DSC Community.
Former plans &amp;amp; realignment Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s DSC Team, about a year and an half ago, was working on a new version of the LCM component of the DSC Platform.</description>

      <description>Correct Format for Parameter Block  An empty parameter block should be displayed on its own line like this: param (). A non-empty parameter block should have the opening and closing parentheses on their own line. All text inside the parameter block should be indented once. Every parameter should include the [Parameter()] attribute, regardless of whether the attribute requires decoration or not. A parameter that is mandatory should contain this decoration: [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)].</description>

      <description>General Rules  Tests are written using Pester. Preferably use the concept of test-driven development when writing tests. Each DSC module should contain the following Test folder structure:  tests |---Unit |---Integration  The tests\Unit folder must contain a Test Script for each DSC Resource in the DSC Module with the filename DSC_&amp;lt;ResourceName&amp;gt;.Tests.ps1. The tests\Integration folder should, whenever possible, contain a Test Script for each DSC Resource in the DSC Module with the filename DSC_&amp;lt;ResourceName&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Although adopting the best practices is optional, doing so will help improve the quality of the DSC resource module.
Note: Modules that aim to meet the High Quality Resource Module standards must also implement the best practices wherever possible.
Avoid Using ard coded Computer Name Using hard coded computer names exposes sensitive information on your machine. Use a parameter or environment variable instead if a computer name is necessary. This comes from this PS Script Analyzer rule.</description>

      <description>Avoid Cmdlet Aliases When calling a function use the full command not an alias. You can get the full command an alias represents by calling Get-Alias.
Bad:
ls -File $root -Recurse | ? { @(&amp;#39;.gitignore&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;.mof&amp;#39;) -contains $_.Extension } Good:
Get-ChildItem -File $root -Recurse | Where-Object -FilterScript { @(&amp;#39;.gitignore&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;.mof&amp;#39;) -contains $_.Extension } Avoid Invoke-Expression Invoke-Expression is vulnerable to string injection attacks. It should not be used in any DSC resources.</description>

      <description>The #DSC Channel The community gathers in the Virtual PowerShell User Group #DSC channel, which is an open &amp;amp; instant messaging chat room for all DSC related questions, discussions, and collaboration.
The PowerShell channels are bridged between Discord and Slack, so you can use either service, via the apps or websites.
The Virtual PowerShell User Group contains more than just the #DSC channel: there are also channels covering topics related to PowerShell, DevOps as well as many other and practices and technologies, so you may also join them too.</description>

      <description>Return a Hashtable from Get-TargetResource Bad:
Good:
Return a Boolean from Test-TargetResource Bad:
Good:
Avoid Returning Anything From Set-TargetResource Bad:
Good:
Define Get-TargetResource, Set-TargetResource, and Test-TargetResource for Every DSC Resource Bad:
Good:
Get-TargetResource should not contain unused non-mandatory parameters The inclusion of a non-mandatory parameter that is never used could signal that there is a design flaw in the implementation of the Get-TargetResource function. The non-mandatory parameters that are used to call Get-TargetResource should help to retrieve the actual values of the properties for the resource.</description>

      <description>Avoid Using Deprecated Manifest Fields Bad:
Good:
Ensure Manifest Contains Correct Fields Bad:
Good:
Do not use NestedModules to export shared commands Since we don&amp;rsquo;t use the RootModule key in the module manifest, we should not use the NestedModules key to add modules that export commands that are shared between resource modules.
Normally, a single list in the RootModule key, can restrict what is exported using the cmdlet Export-ModuleMember. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t use the RootModule key we can&amp;rsquo;t restrict what is exported, so every nested module will export all the commands (or all the commands restricted by Export-ModuleMember in that individual nested module).</description>

      <description>In each resource folder there should be at least one localization folder for english language &amp;lsquo;en-US&amp;rsquo;. Add other localization folders as appropriate, the correct folder name can be found by running Get-UICulture on the node that has a UI culture installed that the strings are being built for. There is also the list of Available Language Packs for Windows.
In each localization folder there should be a PowerShell data (.psd1) file named &amp;lsquo;DSC_&amp;lt;ResourceName&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Capitalized Pester Assertions Pester assertions should all start with capital letters. This makes code easier to read.
Bad:
it &amp;#39;Should return something&amp;#39; { get-targetresource @testParameters | should -be &amp;#39;something&amp;#39; } Good:
It &amp;#39;Should return something&amp;#39; { Get-TargetResource @testParameters | Should -Be &amp;#39;something&amp;#39; } Assertion Messages Start with Should Pester assertions should always start with the word &amp;lsquo;Should&amp;rsquo;. This is to ensure the test results read more naturally as well as helping to indentify assertion messages that aren&amp;rsquo;t making assertions.</description>

      <description>Recording   Quick update on activity  Azure DevOps has removed the build worker Ubuntu 16.04. Repos using it in the pipeline (well, all of them) need to change to &amp;lsquo;ubuntu-latest&amp;rsquo;. Example: https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/pull/1733/files Azure Devops has deprecated the build worker Windows Server 2016 (&amp;lsquo;windows-2016&amp;rsquo;). Repos using that for unit test or integration tests need to move to &amp;lsquo;windows-2019&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;windows-2022&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;windows-latest&amp;rsquo; before March 2022. This may cause problems with assuring support on older operating systems.</description>

      <description>Recently, the PowerShell team announced plans to create a new JSON-based schema so that eventually PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) could get rid of its MOF/CIM dependencies, and the PowerShell code base could remove its deprecated Management Interface (MI) implementation (Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimProperty, Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance and so on&amp;hellip;).
The suggested change was only for DSC Resources schema, and no changes to MOF compilations was announced for now. Removing the CIM/MI/MOF code and dependency is definitely an overarching goal for PowerShell, but it won&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight.</description>

UPDATE: To convert tests for a repository in DSC Community also see the blog Convert tests to Pester 5 for a DSC Community repository
Pester Pester, the famous DSL and module in the PowerShell community, is used throughout the DSC modules and their common modules to ensure we maintain quality for all new contributions by testing any addition and verify they work with the rest of the code to avoid regression.</description>

      <description>This assumes the repository is using the pattern from the Sampler project. Also make sure you have updated the repository to the latest pipeline.
Table of Contents  Introduction Not building module, just copying files Building whole or part of module Code coverage for multiple jobs  Introduction With the release of Pester v4.10 it is now possible to upload the Pester generated JoCoCo file. The same file is used to upload code coverage to both Azure Pipelines and to Codecov.</description>

      <guid>https://dsccommunity.org/blog/use-dscresource-common-functions-in-module/</guid>
      <description>What This article will explain the steps needed to use a version of the DscResource.Common module that has been released to the PowerShell Gallery.
The module DscResource.Common currently has 7 cmdlets.
 Get-LocalizedData New-InvalidArgumentException New-InvalidOperationException New-NotImplementedException New-InvalidResultException New-ObjectNotFoundException Test-DscParameterState  Why Historically, these functions have been duplicated into many DSC resource modules. This has resulted in duplication of effort in maintaining them as well as drift in the code base and feature set with some fixes not being included.</description>

Before you start, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of what the new CI looks like:    NOTE: The build is running on Linux in the CI pipeline to be able to support cross-platform DSC resources, so that makes all paths case-sensitive! Have that in mind when updating paths and folders in the configuration files.</description>

      <description>The Local Configuration Manager (LCM) in PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) logs its deployment progress and errors on several places. The most commonly known location is the event log, where errors are logged in the log: Applications and Services Logs \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Desired State Configuration \ Operational
This log contains various events that were generated during a DSC job, it is however less useful to track the progress of a running job.</description>

      <title>Realizing maintenance windows with DSC</title>

      <description>Introduction Since 2017 I have been involved in a number of DSC projects in medium to very large enterprises. It has not been easy to implement DSC for a number of reasons. For some companies, the reason why DSC was not an option is the lack of support for maintenance windows. DSC runs whenever an internal timer expires. This is fine for some enterprises but not for all. This article summarizes the ideas and technical implementation I have worked on with two large enterprises.</description>

      <description>A lot of improvements have been made to the Sampler module and templates in the last couple of weeks, and it&amp;rsquo;s a (small) breaking change that needs a manual update to your repos.
We knew for a long time that Sampler was needed some refactor to make it more testable and maintainable. A while ago, we took some shortcuts we knew we&amp;rsquo;d have to refactor at some point, and we finally did it!</description>
