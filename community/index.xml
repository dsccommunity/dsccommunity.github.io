      <description>The DSC Resource Kit A lot has changed since the creation of the DSC Resource Kit back in 2013â€”the PowerShell/DSC Team initiative was created to seed the DSC Ecosystem.
The intention then was to illustrate the capabilities of DSC, and solve realistic configuration scenarios to build a community of users. The team had been developing the resources and publishing them as the PowerShell Team in TechNet Gallery, long before the PowerShell Gallery existed.</description>

      <description>Goal and purpose Previously owned by the DSC Team, and more specifically by Katie, the DSC Resources are now owned by the DSC Community: a collective of Open Source maintainers getting together to improve the Resources, their quality and the practices around DSC.
The main purpose is to handle better the increased community contributions, and remove hindrance to improvements by spreading the load on a Committee, and giving more privileges to the maintainers.</description>

      <description>The #DSC Channel The community gathers in the Virtual PowerShell User Group #DSC channel, which is an open &amp;amp; instant messaging chat room for all DSC related questions, discussions, and collaboration.
The PowerShell channels are bridged between Discord and Slack, so you can use either service, via the apps or websites.
The Virtual PowerShell User Group contains more than just the #DSC channel: there are also channels covering topics related to PowerShell, DevOps as well as many other and practices and technologies, so you may also join them too.</description>
